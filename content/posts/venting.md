I find myself compelled to write here for two reasons:

1. I'd rather not explicitly bother people by forcing them to listen to me
2. A written record may be useful for future reflection


# How can I be positive when I don't see positivity?

Anyone who knows me would never have described me as a "fountain of positivity",
that is to say I am not trying to describe some dramatic shift of my viewpoint.
Rather, I should like to catalogue my water against stone descent. 

Firstly, I must address the obvious. Am I growing more pessimistic, or is the
gradient of pessimistic just such that it always looks downwards? To this I
give two answers.

1. I have never been at a point where I felt writing would help, the state of affairs must be truly terrible for me to commit to a keyboard my thoughts
2. My regular self-reassurances have failed me

Allow me to elaborate on this second point. Like many I tell myself that the
evils we see are not representative of the true population. Sometimes I hope
that the cruel things people do is just ignorance. I was recently alerted to the
issues I would cause some individuals by parking my car half on a curb in
residential areas. It never crossed my mind that I was creating accessibility
problems for others. How many thousands of things, meaningless as they are to
me, are everything to others. So, this hope of ignorance over maliciousness is a
psyche saving thought. 

This of course breaks down when you speak to some people:

- "Yes I voted for this because I hate X"
- "Yes, I do believe people X are inferior to people Y"
- "Why would I care"
- "They deserve it"
- "It was their choice, they knew the risks"

Still, like a mantra for years I convinced myself that this is not truly
representative. 

The voices of evil, division, (insert other dramatic adjectives) and
maliciousness, are just too loud. Too frequent. Too much.


# Solution?

Hmmm. Not to be too on the nose, but this is where I would put a solution if I
had one. 

I guess I don't really believe that our issues as people are solvable. So the
question is more localised and specific: How does one keep going? 

When I think about things in this way I am flooded with thoughts of making
coffee in the morning and pushing rocks up hills. Creature of habit that I am,
that's the solution and the answer. 

It's really just existence through routine.
