I'm in a mirror, swimming at night. 
Those numbers are just null and void to me now 

They buried your mother, but you are just a face now
Hooks held down, now set you loose

We could have went forward through the night
but I took a now strangers car. 

Biggest regret is about the guitar 
sunburnt and childhood dreamed. It could have been mine 

Mind games, I hoped were smarter. 
They could have just been tessellating chocolate bars. 

Lessons of loved burned in.
Taught that I didn't need him

That resilience just passed onto you
and you're just a face to me now.
