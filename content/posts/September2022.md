# Summary 

The title of this blog may be “September”, but it's really more of a summary of
things for the last few months. 

Where to start? 

Hmmm. Maybe a little honesty and insight is useful. Prior to August 2022 I thought it
was perfectly normal to have a general distaste for life, and that we all just
went through because of some strange biological compulsion. What I am trying to
stress here is that for the first time in 28 years I have become happy. 

When I started my new job, I quickly realised that my demeanour had changed
significantly. My reactive responses to questions became different. When asked
"how are you?" my old response would be "Fine, thanks, you?", now I find myself
saying "Fantastic! You?". Whilst this may seem silly and trivial it is something
that I could not help but say, and that is how I realised that life can be good. 

# What changed? 

Why am I compelled to be happy? 

Well, I don't have to be stressed any more. I finally feel like my life has
started to be worth something. This change has come about through three
shakeups: 

1. PhD is done 
2. I have my dream job
3. Moved to London

Doing the PhD was one of the best things I have done with my life, but OH GOD am
I glad it's dead. 

## PhD's are unsuitable for humans 

Allow me to be perfectly clear: my supervisor, friends and most of the people I
interacted with during my studies are amazing people and have been lovely to me.
But, there is something... something I can't quite perfectly explain. Maybe it's
the unspoken (sometimes) expectation within academia to overwork, or the
[disgusting](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03069-w) salaries paid
to the backbone of our academic system, the PhD students. Maybe it's the
uncertainty? It could even be the loneliness. Yes, as a student I was surrounded
by caring people, but they had their projects and I had mine. Sometimes we
worked adjacent to one another, but we each had very specific things which we
owned. Perhaps it's the feeling of simultaneously being expected to be a world
leading expert on a topic whilst also constantly being bombarded with questions
that make you feel stupid? 

**I loved my PhD experience, but I am so glad it is dead**. I cannot in good faith
suggest that anyone take that path, if they have an alternative. 

## Respect makes a world of difference! 

It had always been my dream to pursue academia, and I never even considered
leaving. Until I did. 

These thoughts and feelings are only able to come to the surface because I am
now free of the academic system. 

Allow me to elaborate: when in academia I was constantly encouraged to perform
outreach, to teach and to participate with the wider community... BUT NOT DURING
WORKING HOURS. So when did they expect this? And when people did these extra
activities there was always the question of "will this damage your research?".
Academia expects everything from you, and then asks for more.

When I migrated to academia-adjacent work I was taken aback by the encouragement
I received to pursue the things that made me happy: 
- "Can I arrange this hackathon?" - "Yes Aoife, let us know how we can support you".
-  "Can I use work time to do data science work with this relevant charity" - "Sure". 
-  "Can I apply for these grants?" - "Of course, we will happily support you". 

Respect. That's the difference. My new workplace respects me, they make me feel
like what I say and do matters. They prove this by backing me. The same things
are felt in how they respect thoughts and opinions about work projects too. 

## I always dreamed of living in a city 

When I first read The Great Gatsby I was obsessed with the character. Perhaps I
missed the points about obsessive love and the destruction that it can bring.
What I saw was someone who saw the world how they wanted it to be and then made
it so. 

A large part of this was the running away from home. My final stage of running
away is making it to London. 

To shopping, to sitting in cafés, eating good food and socialising. Late night
trains and lights which never go out. The 3 am shouts and the 6 am door slams.
These are the things I've craved for. 

# Conclusion

Sorry for the rambling. I started writing this in one mood and then fell to
another. Thanks Bon Iver. They have that effect, wouldn't you agree? 

Anyway, life is really good. I wish this post could be sent backwards and that I
could read it a year ago. I needed it then.
