and all your past lives
all these things that push me
are not things that should worry me
Fill this head with ideas,
that convince her you&amp;rsquo;re not real
you&amp;rsquo;re just someone who lives in a bottom in your attic
and now we&amp;rsquo;re both empty</description></item><item><title>Poem00</title><link>/posts/poem00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 19:28:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/poem00/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m in a mirror, swimming at night.
Those numbers are just null and void to me now
They buried your mother, but you are just a face now
Hooks held down, now set you loose
We could have went forward through the night
but I took a now strangers car.
Biggest regret is about the guitar
sunburnt and childhood dreamed. It could have been mine
Mind games, I hoped were smarter.</description></item></channel></rss>
