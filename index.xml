Even as reviews and benchmarks came pouring in after the original M1 Macbook Pro, Mini and Air released I was skeptical. Working in research we often find that tools we depend on are ancient by computer standards, even worse is that some of them are either difficult to build/update or are closed source (or worse still, written in PERL!). Which highlights my major fear of Apple&amp;rsquo;s new direction, I was initially terrified that almost all of my pipelines and tools would die in x86 and I would be forced to migrate to, ugh, Windows.</description></item><item><title>Visualising World Temperature Data</title><link>/posts/temp-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 00:57:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/temp-data/</guid><description>I like to start with the end result of a project, just to show if this is what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for before you read:
Some caveats:
These data are limited to what a 10 second google search yielded (I found it on Kaggle) Data are approximately matched to country codes in order to streamline things Year range of data is very limited Code is written in an obtuse way in order to make clear what is happening There is little need for multiple lists matching data codes for example Some countries are missing data, easily solved with better country code matching and a better data source Libraries required for this:</description></item><item><title>Narrow Escape Visualization</title><link>/posts/narrow-escape/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 13:45:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/narrow-escape/</guid><description>The Narrow Escape Problem is a bio physics problem which attempts to estimate how long it takes for a particle moving under Brownian motion to escape from a container with solid walls, where part of the wall is open.
Recently we published a software library for building narrow escape simulations. We also used this to discuss its use in determining the escape time for small molecules from plant cells.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working with plotly to create interactive plots.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:28:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Hi, Thanks for coming to my new blog.
