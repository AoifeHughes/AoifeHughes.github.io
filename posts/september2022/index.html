things for the last few months.</p><p>Where to start?</p><p>Hmmm. Maybe a little honesty and insight is useful. Prior to August 2022 I thought it
was perfectly normal to have a general distaste for life, and that we all just
went through because of some strange biological compulsion. What I am trying to
stress here is that for the first time in 28 years I have become happy.</p><p>When I started my new job, I quickly realised that my demeanour had changed
significantly. My reactive responses to questions became different. When asked
&ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; my old response would be &ldquo;Fine, thanks, you?&rdquo;, now I find myself
saying &ldquo;Fantastic! You?&rdquo;. Whilst this may seem silly and trivial it is something
that I could not help but say, and that is how I realised that life can be good.</p><h1 id=what-changed>What changed?<a href=#what-changed class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>Why am I compelled to be happy?</p><p>Well, I don&rsquo;t have to be stressed any more. I finally feel like my life has
started to be worth something. This change has come about through three
shakeups:</p><ol><li>PhD is done</li><li>I have my dream job</li><li>Moved to London</li></ol><p>Doing the PhD was one of the best things I have done with my life, but OH GOD am
I glad it&rsquo;s dead.</p><h2 id=phds-are-unsuitable-for-humans>PhD&rsquo;s are unsuitable for humans<a href=#phds-are-unsuitable-for-humans class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2><p>Allow me to be perfectly clear: my supervisor, friends and most of the people I
interacted with during my studies are amazing people and have been lovely to me.
But, there is something&mldr; something I can&rsquo;t quite perfectly explain. Maybe it&rsquo;s
the unspoken (sometimes) expectation within academia to overwork, or the
<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03069-w>disgusting</a> salaries paid
to the backbone of our academic system, the PhD students. Maybe it&rsquo;s the
uncertainty? It could even be the loneliness. Yes, as a student I was surrounded
by caring people, but they had their projects and I had mine. Sometimes we
worked adjacent to one another, but we each had very specific things which we
owned. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the feeling of simultaneously being expected to be a world
leading expert on a topic whilst also constantly being bombarded with questions
that make you feel stupid?</p><p><strong>I loved my PhD experience, but I am so glad it is dead</strong>. I cannot in good faith
suggest that anyone take that path, if they have an alternative.</p><h2 id=respect-makes-a-world-of-difference>Respect makes a world of difference!<a href=#respect-makes-a-world-of-difference class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2><p>It had always been my dream to pursue academia, and I never even considered
leaving. Until I did.</p><p>These thoughts and feelings are only able to come to the surface because I am
now free of the academic system.</p><p>Allow me to elaborate: when in academia I was constantly encouraged to perform
outreach, to teach and to participate with the wider community&mldr; BUT NOT DURING
WORKING HOURS. So when did they expect this? And when people did these extra
activities there was always the question of &ldquo;will this damage your research?&rdquo;.
Academia expects everything from you, and then asks for more.</p><p>When I migrated to academia-adjacent work I was taken aback by the encouragement
I received to pursue the things that made me happy:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Can I arrange this hackathon?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Yes Aoife, let us know how we can support you&rdquo;.</li><li>&ldquo;Can I use work time to do data science work with this relevant charity&rdquo; - &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;.</li><li>&ldquo;Can I apply for these grants?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Of course, we will happily support you&rdquo;.</li></ul><p>Respect. That&rsquo;s the difference. My new workplace respects me, they make me feel
like what I say and do matters. They prove this by backing me. The same things
are felt in how they respect thoughts and opinions about work projects too.</p><h2 id=i-always-dreamed-of-living-in-a-city>I always dreamed of living in a city<a href=#i-always-dreamed-of-living-in-a-city class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2><p>When I first read The Great Gatsby I was obsessed with the character. Perhaps I
missed the points about obsessive love and the destruction that it can bring.
What I saw was someone who saw the world how they wanted it to be and then made
it so.</p><p>A large part of this was the running away from home. My final stage of running
away is making it to London.</p><p>To shopping, to sitting in cafés, eating good food and socialising. Late night
trains and lights which never go out. The 3 am shouts and the 6 am door slams.
These are the things I&rsquo;ve craved for.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a href=#conclusion class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>Sorry for the rambling. I started writing this in one mood and then fell to
another. Thanks Bon Iver. They have that effect, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?</p><p>Anyway, life is really good. I wish this post could be sent backwards and that I
could read it a year ago.
