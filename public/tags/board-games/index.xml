      <description>Intro Marvel champions is the latest living card game (LCG) from fantasy flight games. If you are familiar with other entries in this series of games, such as Arkham Horror The Card Game, then not much introduction is needed. These games come with a core set that gets you started and allows/encourages you to expand your gameplay through additional expansion packs. Unlike some games on the market, these LCGs and their expansions are not randomised and you always know what youâ€™re getting in your box/card pack.</description>
